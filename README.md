# Toy BLE Stack
A toy Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack for learning purposes.

The goal of this project is to get a very basic BLE-only Host stack up and running in order to learn more about BLE internals.

# Contributing

Please do! I have very limited time to work on this but would love to keep it going.

Things to know:

- This project mostly follows the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), modified for C.
- A major goal of this project is readable, easy to understand code. Concepts should be well-documented within the code itself, with references to external documentation such as the BLE specification.
